# Self Driving Car Project
### Introduction
This project covers a Second Level Autonomous Car that uses a Deep Learning Model and some of the Computer Vision Techniques.
It is built on a 1:20 scale hobby RC model car that is controlled by a Raspberry Pi (Client) wirelessly connected to a Computer (Server).
There are six levels of autonomy. These are from 0 to 5. The levels of autonomy describe the system, not the vehicle. 
Level 0: This one is pretty basic. The driver (human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. 
Level 1: This driver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled by the driver.
Level 2: One driver assistance system of "both steering and acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment" is           automated, like cruise control and lane-centering.
