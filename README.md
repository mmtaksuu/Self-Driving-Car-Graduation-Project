# Self Driving Car Project
### Introduction
This project covers a Second Level Autonomous Car that uses a Deep Learning Model and some of the Computer Vision Techniques.
It is built on a 1:20 scale hobby RC model car that is controlled by a Raspberry Pi (Client) wirelessly connected to a Computer (Server).
There are six levels of autonomy. These are from 0 to 5. The levels of autonomy describe the system, not the vehicle. 

### Levels of Autonomy
- **Level 0:** This one is pretty basic. The driver (human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. 
- **Level 1:** This driver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled by the driver.
- **Level 2:** One driver assistance system of "both steering and acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment" is automated, like cruise control and lane-centering. The driver must still always be ready to take control of the vehicle.
- **Level 3:** Drivers are able to completely shift "safety-critical functions" to the vehicle, under certain traffic or environmental conditions.
- **Level 4:** Vehicles are designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip.
- **Level 5:** This refers to a fully-autonomous system that expects the vehicle's performance to equal that of a human driver, in every driving scenario.
